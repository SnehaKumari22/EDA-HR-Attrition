# EDA-HR-Attrition
Performed some exploratory data analysis and made visualizations to understand the factors leading to attrition in a given company

This report will analyze the question: What makes employees stay or leave our company? The goal of this report is to give our HR department insight into what employees want from their employers. We are interested in providing this information to the HR department in order to foster a healthy work environment where employees feel supported and productive. To gather useful statistics and information we analyzed the dataset “HR Employee Analytics” published on the website Kaggle.

This dataset contains 11 columns and 15,000 rows, with the target column being whether or not an individual stayed or left a company. We conducted an exploratory data analysis on this dataset and found that an individual's overall satisfaction level, weekly hours, number of projects, work department, and salary have a strong influence on if they left the company. This report will provide information on each of these variables as well as supporting visualizations to emphasize the impact the variables have on attrition rate.
